		<p>As a widespread effort to change math education, we have set a goal to send a DVD to every public middle school in the United States!  All proceeds from your donation will be dedicated to achieving this goal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pledge $25 or more and you’ll also receive a copy of the film for yourself (free shipping in the US; additional shipping charges will apply for international addresses). Please remember to provide the name and address of the middle school(s) you’d like to receive the DVD(s) in the comments section of your pledge.  If you don't have a middle school to suggest, we will send to the next one(s) on the list!
		</p>
		<p>
			You can make a donation directly through our Kickstarter Campaign.
